This is Kritika's page. Kiki's world as I have started to call it now, considering she is an apple user. Apple world, kiki world. iwebsite. And this is the thing with her hands that any other phone than Iphone would be considered a crime against god. It is almost as god created Steve Jobs with the sole purpose of creating a suitable phone for Kritika's hands. For me, it is no more apple ecosystem but 'kiki ecosystem' for which iphone is just one part of it.

I must tell her age as well. Numerically it is tough for me but still let me try...she is as young and fresh as first love or first Lilly of the spring and as old as some Italian fine wine. So yeah! she is somewhere in between. She claims that she lives on earth, but I am highly skeptical. I have seen such creatures before in fairy tales and do you know where do they live? in sky. She live in clouds. Otherwise why would you find so many random sunset (and cloud) photos in her phone as if it was her home? Don't you believe that she is some fairy tale character? Just look at her skin, isn't it fair enough to be part of fairy tale? hun?

Anyways, moving further, for all the time she was with me she never asked much from me, but still I usually sit under the night sky, till today, waiting for it to fall such that I can catch some stars for her. But this little princess of mine does not want any star!

Man has always been dependent on mother earth. For food, for shelter and for any other need which may arise. But Kritika aspires to be independent. Man has always been dependent but Kritika aspires to be independent, maybe because she is a woman that's why?!

For whatever she is, she is a hardworking woman, and to put cheery on top, she is smart. Did I say she is beautiful as well? Need I?
